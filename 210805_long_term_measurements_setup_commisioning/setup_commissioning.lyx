\begin_layout Abstract
In this document I provide an update on the commissioning of setup for the
 long term studies of irradiated LGAD detectors at UZH.
 This setup is intended to periodically monitor the characteristics and
 performance of irradiated LGAD detectors while they are kept constantly
 biased for a long period of time.

 For this, a dedicated setup is under implementation at UZH consisting of
 several hardware equipment and customized controlling and analysis software.

 The setup was designed to handle up to eight devices simultaneously.
 The devices are individually controlled and monitored, independently from
 one another.
 Two CAEN high voltage power supplies provide the high voltage to bias the
 LGADs, while at the same time are used to monitor the bias current and
 regularly trace IV curves of each device.
 An oscilloscope and a PSI DRS4 evaluation board

 to beta radiation from an Sr-90 source.
 A robotic system moves the Sr-90 beta source and MCP-PMT time reference
 from one LGAD to the other.
 All the setup is automatically controlled by a computer which runs a customized
 software.

IV-curve measurements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current-voltage (IV) characteristic of an LGAD detector provides valuable
 information.
 The setup measures the IV curve of each device periodically, using the
 values of bias voltage and current provided by the high voltage power supplies.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 an IV-curve measurement example is shown (label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Measurement setup through CAEN
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The bias voltage and the current are the values that were feed into the
 Chubut board.
 The current corresponds to the sum of the current of the four pads (3 wire
 bonded to ground, one connected to the amplifier input, see
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) plus the guard ring, which is wire bonded to ground.
 The amplifier input is kept at 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx0\UNIT V$
\end_inset

 DC, while the backside of the device is where the bias voltage is applied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This measurement (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) is compared against an IV characterization of the same device made with
 a probe station before mounting the device in the readout board.
 In this case, the guard ring was grounded, one of the pads was kept fixed
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $0\UNIT V$
\end_inset

 and the bias voltage was applied to the backside through the chuck.
 The current shown under the label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 is the current flowing through the backside.

Example of an IV curve measured by the setup using one of the high voltage
 power supplies.
 The measurement is compared with another measurement of the same device
 made with a probe station before mounting the device in the readout board.
 Both measurements were taken at 
\begin_inset Formula $-20\text{ ¬∞C}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Figure: example of IV measurement"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As seen, the two measurements differ significantly; the current measured
 by the CAEN is considerably higher than the current measured by the probe
 station, and the current measured in the probe station has an extra kink
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim80-90\UNIT V$
\end_inset

.
 To account for these differences let's consider the following expressions
 for the current in each case
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\LBRACE{\begin{aligned} & I_{\text{CAEN}}\approx4I_{\text{pad}}+I_{\text{guard ring}}\\
 & I_{\text{probe station}}\approx I_{\text{pad}}+I_{\text{guard ring}}
\end{aligned}
}
\]

\end_inset

 after the connections described for each case.
 If we focus in the region where the gain layer depletes the change in the
 total current (i.e.
 the measured current) should be dominated by the variations in 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{\text{pad}}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\EVALUATEDAT{\frac{\DIFERENTIAL I_{\text{guard ring}}}{\DIFERENTIAL V}}{\text{Gain layer depletes}}{}\ll\EVALUATEDAT{\frac{\DIFERENTIAL I_{\text{pad}}}{\DIFERENTIAL V}}{\text{Gain layer depletes}}{}\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

 Following this idea we should observe that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\EVALUATEDAT{\frac{\DIFERENTIAL I_{\text{CAEN}}}{\DIFERENTIAL V}}{\text{Gain layer depletes}}{}\approx4\EVALUATEDAT{\frac{\DIFERENTIAL I_{\text{probe station}}}{\DIFERENTIAL V}}{\text{Gain layer depletes}}{}\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

 The depletion of the gain layer is happening between 
\begin_inset Formula $-35\UNIT V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-40\UNIT V$
\end_inset

 approximately.
 In the measurement using the probe station the increase between 
\begin_inset Formula $-35\UNIT V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-40\UNIT V$
\end_inset

 is of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\EVALUATEDAT{\frac{\DIFERENTIAL I_{\text{probe station}}}{\DIFERENTIAL V}}{\text{Gain layer depletes}}{}\approx135\NANO A-94.3\NANO A=40.7\NANO A\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

 For the measurement with the CAEN the current increase in the same voltage
 range is about 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\EVALUATEDAT{\frac{\DIFERENTIAL I_{\text{CAEN}}}{\DIFERENTIAL V}}{\text{Gain layer depletes}}{}\approx350\NANO A-190\NANO A=160\NANO A\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

The ratio of these two currents is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{160\NANO A}{40.7\NANO A}=3.9
\]

\end_inset

which seem to indicate that the previous reasoning is correct.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With respect to the difference at 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx-90\UNIT V$
\end_inset

, the second kink in the measurement with the probe station, not present
 on the measurement with the CAEN, may be due to border effects in the pads
 left floating.

Timing measurements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the most relevant measurement is the time resolution of each detector;
 after all the detectors will be used for this.
 To monitor the time resolution of each detector a precise MCP-PMT reference
 detector will be used as trigger, as described previously.
 This detector was already ordered to the manufacturer, but it has not yet
 arrived to our lab.
 In the meantime a non-irradiated CNM LGAD detector with a time resolution
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $27\PICO s$
\end_inset

 will be used.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Work is ongoing on the commissioning of the setup for the long term tests
 of irradiated LGAD devices.
 The setup is already partially operational and monitoring the standby current
 of eight detectors.
 There is still work to do in terms both of hardware and software.
 It is expected to have it fully operational in about 2-4 months.

<p>As I mentioned in the previous post, we are planning to measure irradiated TI-LGADs in our TCT setup in the near future. After irradiation the bias current of these devices is considerably higher and since it has an exponential dependence on temperature[1] they are usually cooled down to limit it. To this end I made some modifications to our TCT setup so it can reach temperatures lower than -20 °C. </p>

<p>First of all I designed a simple four channel and passive readout board shown below. This board was designed in such a way that it is small enough to fit within the Peltier cells included in the TCT setup and at the same time has a flat surface, except in one side where the connectors are, so it has a good thermal contact. It also hosts a temperature and humidity sensor (the black chip below the pad to stick the DUT).</p>

<p>In conjunction with this board I designed three 3D printed pieces to arrange everything in place. This is, to keep the four Peltier cells arranged in a pyramidal way (mimicking <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=peltier+stacking&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjEl_-hhrf0AhXT0oUKHYT6BfcQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=peltier+stack&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgBMgcIIxDvAxAnMgcIIxDvAxAnMggIABAIEB4QE1AAWABggRRoAHAAeACAAX-IAX-SAQMwLjGYAQCqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=4VuhYYSjJ9OllwSE9Ze4Dw&bih=964&biw=1644&client=ubuntu&hs=1Fn">this</a>), on top of this the readout board, and finally the dry air system to avoid ice formation.</p>

</div>

<p>The whole system seems to behave pretty well as seen in the plot below, during a quick test:</p>

<p>The arrange of Peltier cells drains about 4 Ampère at about 12 V (yes, quite inefficient but it gets the job done). During a quick test the setup stabilized at about -22 °C while the dry air was flowing preventing ice from forming. Without this dry air the system can reach a lower temperature (-28&nbsp;°C) but ice is produced (I tested this).</p>

<p>Everything seems to be ready for the measurements of the irradiated devices&nbsp;✅.</p>

\begin_layout Abstract
This time I studied what happens with the spacial resolution of an AC-LGAD
 when multiple pads are interconnected together producing one single, big
 and extended pad.
 This is potentially interesting because it may allow to reduce the density
 of readout channels per unit area of detector while keeping its performance,
 simplifying thus the electronics, reducing the power consumption and also
 the amount of data flowing out of the detector.

\end_inset

 now I wanted to test if there could be any improvement by changing the
 shape of the pads.
 It turns out that in AC-LGADs there is almost total freedom on what the
 shape of the pads is, it is not restricted to squares but instead they
 can take any 2D shape.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AC-LGAD samples we have available in our lab have nine square pads arranged
 in a 3 by 3 matrix.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Figure: microscope picture of the LGAD"

\end_inset

 there is a picture of such a device.
 To explore how the shape of the pads can influence the performance of the
 detector, I decided to do a quick test interconnecting some of the pads
 between themselves as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Figure: microscope picture of the LGAD"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 As can be seen the result is a device with only four channels, instead
 of nine, that still cover the whole area of the original nine pads.
 Now we can think that each single-colored pair of pads is indeed a single
 pad with a non-connected

 shape.
 Although I did this just because it was easy to do with the hardware I
 had available, this could, in principle, be implemented in a readout chip
 connected to the AC-LGAD.

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately the measurement was affected by an intermittent source of
 noise.
 This can be seen in the presence of vertical noisy and no-noisy strips
 in the plots of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Figure: collected charge plots"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This noise, of course, worsened the results that will be shown later on.
 The process of taking this measurement takes several hours/days, thus each
 vertical strip represents a different moment in time.
 It was not possible to locate the origin of this noise yet, and it is still
 affecting new measurements in the lab.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The procedure I followed was the same as for my other measurements (see
 e.g.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 Namely, I produced one training and one testing dataset which I then used
 with the MLE algorithm.
 Results can be seen in

 In each measured

\begin_layout Standard
In order to study the performance of the detector, I defined a total of
 5 regions numbered from 1 to 4 and one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

main region
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Figure: reconstruction error mean colormap"

\end_inset

.
 The regions 1 to 4 are just squares while the region named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

main region
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the difference between the outer square and the inner square, i.e.
 the area between the two squares.
 For each of these regions the reconstruction error distribution in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, in 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and in absolute value 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$
\end_inset

 is shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Figure: x error distribution"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Figure: combined error distribution"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 respectively.
 To ease visualization and compare different regions it is possible to enable/di
sable traces by clicking in the legend of each plot.
 We see that events from regions 1 and 2 have better (smaller) 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 error, given by the width of each distribution, than events from regions
 3 and 4, and the inverse is true in the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 direction.
 This can be understood by the position of each region with respect to the
 pads: regions 1 and 2 are closer to pads in the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 direction and far from pads in the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 direction, creating this a steeper gradient of collected charge in the
 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 direction and an almost flat dependency in the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 direction, as can be seen in the charge color maps of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Figure: collected charge plots"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The same applies to regions 3 and 4 inverting 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Events in the region called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

main region
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 show, obviously, a combined effect from the other regions.
 Both the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 components of the reconstruction error follow a strange distribution (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Figure: x error distribution"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) which seems to have two components: 1) a Gaussian like main peak in the
 middle and 2) tails that extend further from this Gaussian main peak.
 A Gaussian distribution was fitted to the main peak for each coordinate
 (see the figures) obtaining from each 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\LBRACE{\begin{aligned} & \sigma_{x\text{ Gaussian fit}}^{\text{main region}}=36.5\MICRO m\\
 & \sigma_{y\text{ Gaussian fit}}^{\text{main region}}=35.2\MICRO m
\end{aligned}
}
\]

\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\text{ Gaussian fit}}^{\text{main region}}\approx50.7\MICRO m\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

 If, instead, we look at all the data and calculate its standard deviation
 we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\LBRACE{\begin{aligned} & \sigma_{x\text{ all data}}^{\text{main region}}=78.8\MICRO m\\
 & \sigma_{y\text{ all data}}^{\text{main region}}=76.8\MICRO m
\end{aligned}
}
\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\text{ all data}}^{\text{main region}}=110\MICRO m\text{.}

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How can we tell if these results are good or not? In reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Reference: spacial resolution of 200 um AC-LGAD"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 I measured the spacial resolution of the exact same device when it was
 connected 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normally
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In that opportunity I obtained a spacial resolution of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\LBRACE{\begin{aligned} & \sigma_{x\text{ interpad region}}^{\text{regular connection}}=6.24\MICRO m\\
 & \sigma_{y\text{ interpad region}}^{\text{regular connection}}=5.96\MICRO m
\end{aligned}
}
\]

\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\text{ interpad region}}^{\text{regular connection}}=8.63\MICRO m
\]

\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

interpad region
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the region between the four pads.
 Of course in this case we expect a better resolution because the pitch
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $200\MICRO m$
\end_inset

 against about twice in the current work.
 The question now is how to compare these two results.
 One possibility is to define a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spacial resolution efficiency
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta\DEF\frac{\sqrt{A}}{\sigma N}
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is the area of some region 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 any of the regions in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Figure: reconstruction error mean colormap"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the spacial resolution obtained for region 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{R}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 the number of channels.
 With this definition 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 increases with the covered area, it is also bigger for smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 which is what we want, and it becomes worse as we increase the number of
 channels.
 Using this spacial resolution efficiency we can compare the two measurements:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta=\LBRACE{\begin{aligned} & 0.624 &  & \text{for the current work}\\
 & 2.39 &  & \text{for the normal configuration}
\end{aligned}
}\text{.}
\]

\end_inset

Based in this quantity, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal configuration
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Reference: spacial resolution of 200 um AC-LGAD"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 seems to be better than the current configuration mixing pads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A crazy interconnection of the pads in an AC-LGAD was measured with the
 objective of studying how the spacial resolution degrades while keeping
 the same number of channels but covering a bigger area.
 The results showed that the spacial resolution was severely affected, becoming
 a factor of about 
\begin_inset Formula $\gtrsim10$
\end_inset

 bigger, while the area covered with this approach increased in a factor
 of about 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

.
 The results, however, may not be accurate due to the presence of an intermitten
t noise in the measuring setup.
 A further study on this subject may be worth.

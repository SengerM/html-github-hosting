Repository to host personal HTML files.

This was inspired by [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12233684/8849755).

To get a link for rendering an HTML file just do ```https://htmlpreview.github.io/?<github link of the HTML file>```, for example https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SengerM/html-github-hosting/blob/main/201120%2037th%20RD50%20Workshop/Signal%2001191-A.html.

<p>In this document I provide a brief update on the progress of the stability tests of the <siglas>ETL</siglas> detectors. Previous report can be found in reference <crossref toid="Reference: Commissioning of the long-term-studies setup"></crossref>.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The <siglas>ETL</siglas> is a new sub-detector to be installed in the CMS detector during the long shutdown 3&nbsp;<crossref toid="Reference: ETL TDR"></crossref>. It is going to be implemented with <siglas>LGAD</siglas> detectors, a relatively new technology in silicon. Stability tests are ongoing, described in this document, to verify the long-term performance of this technology. A first description of the tests and the planned setup can be found in&nbsp;<crossref toid="Reference: Commissioning of the long-term-studies setup"></crossref>.</p>

<h1>Current status of the setup</h1>

<p>The setup, described in&nbsp;<crossref toid="Reference: Commissioning of the long-term-studies setup"></crossref>, is still under commissioning. The construction of the mechanical system to move the beta source and the timing reference is the most complicated part as it has to be custom-made, but it is almost completed. Some pictures of the setup can be found in <crossref toid="Figure: pictures of the setup"></crossref> where we can see the mentioned mechanical system partially assembled.</p>

<p>All the parts for the setup are already available in our lab with the exception of the MCP-PMT timing reference&nbsp;<crossref toid="Reference: Commissioning of the long-term-studies setup"></crossref> which should arrive within the following two weeks.</p>

<h1>Current results</h1>

<p>Despite the setup not being ready yet, some stability tests were already performed on irradiated devices. These tests consisted on keeping the devices biased at operating voltage<footnote>"Operating voltage" means that bias voltage such that 10&nbsp;fC of charge was produced by the detectors according to a plot sent to me by Nicolò.</footnote> for "a long period of time" while monitoring the bias voltage and current. In <crossref toid="Figure: logged data"></crossref> it shown the bias current, bias voltage, ambient temperature and ambient humidity for eight devices tested for a period of about 4 months. As the setup is still in commissioning the test was interrupted for small periods of time to perform technical tasks. This can be seen in the plots in the periods were the bias voltage was reduced or the temperature increased. Within the periods in which the bias voltage and the temperature were at correct values, with extensions up to 2.5 weeks, no instabilities were observed in the bias current<footnote>This means that there was no point in time at which the bias current showed a peak, or any strange behavior, while both bias voltage and temperature were at the proper values.</footnote>.</p>

<p>An exception is device #10,&nbsp;W18&nbsp;T4&nbsp;4e14&nbsp;n<sub>eq</sub>&nbsp;cm<sup>-2</sup> which reached breakdown before the expected bias voltage. This device, however, showed a different behavior even in the initial IV curves measured in the probe station, see <crossref toid="Figure: IV curve of device rancio"></crossref> (taken from plot in <a href="../210805_long_term_measurements_setup_commisioning/setup_commissioning.html#Figure: probe station measurements">Figure 7 of reference</a>&nbsp;<crossref toid="Reference: Commissioning of the long-term-studies setup"></crossref>).</p>

<p>A more detailed analysis of this data is pending and will be performed once the setup is fully operational, which should happen soon.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Activities are ongoing according to the plan.</li>
	<li>Setup is almost complete, expecting to have it fully operational in one month.</li>
	<li>Current tests (without beta source) show no instabilities on the irradiated LGADs.</li>
</ul>

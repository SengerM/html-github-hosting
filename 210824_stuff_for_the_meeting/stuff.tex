\section{Long term tests on irradiated FBK LGADs}
\begin{itemize}
\item A first report on the commissioning of the setup can be found \href{https://sengerm.github.io/html-github-hosting/210805_long_term_measurements_setup_commisioning/setup_commissioning.html}{here}.
\item The previous document was shared with the Torino group, today we have
meeting to discuss.
\item Wire-bonded 8 of the devices (two per fluence) and started the setup
in ``test mode'' i.e. low bias voltages. Today will discuss which
values should I use.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Some plots}

\caption{Strange bias current measured while the bias voltage was $0\protect\UNIT V$.
I have seen this strange behavior the three times I raised the temperature
to work inside the climate chamber.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Transimpedance calibration of Chubut board}
\begin{itemize}
\item The transimpedance of the \href{https://sengerm.github.io/html-github-hosting/210721_Commissioning_of_Chubut_board/210721_Commissioning_of_Chubut_board.html}{Chubut board}
has to be known to convert voltage measurements into current measurements
(i.e. to measure charge in Coulomb).
\item Should not be complicated.
\item It is not so easy though because it is not easy to differentiate between
noise and signals.
\item Still working on a reliable characterization.
\end{itemize}

\section{TI-LGADs}
\begin{itemize}
\item Laura has been measuring many devices.
\item Deconvolution catastrophe\footnote{In analogy to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe}{ultraviolet catastrophe}.}:
We crashed against devonvoluting the Gaussian of the laser.
\item Now exploring other crazy ideas to obtain the profiles.
\item Laura can tell you better.
\end{itemize}

\section{Chip design}
\begin{itemize}
\item In May I sent the boards I had to PSI so they would wirebond the test
structure of the analog front end.
\item I had no news for a long time.
\item I learned to use the wire bonding machine at UZH.
\item Today I should receive the test structure to wire bond by myself and
start working on it.
\end{itemize}

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In my previous work I have always studied AC-LGADs with 100&nbsp;µm pitch&nbsp;<crossref toid="Reference: First application of machine the empirical likelihood function bla bla bla"></crossref>,&nbsp;<crossref toid="Reference: First time-space characterization of an AC-LGAD"></crossref>. Today I repeated the studies but with a 200&nbsp;µm pitch LGAD. The device I used today is <em>RSD1 W10-A -5,3 3x3 200</em>. Without more preamble I will go directly to the results. In <crossref toid="Figure: Picture of the AC-LGAD"></crossref> there is a picture of the actual device used for this study.</p>

<h1>Results</h1>

<p>As usual I made two scans:
	<ol>
		<li>Training scan: 999 samples at each point with a spacing of 11&nbsp;µm between each point.</li>
		<li>Testing scan: 9 samples at each point with a spacing of 1&nbsp;µm between each point.</li>
	</ol>
	Using these two scans and the reconstruction error defined as 
	<equation id="Equation: Reconstruction error">$$ \text{Reconstruction error}=\sqrt{\left(x_{\text{Laser}}-x_{\text{Reconstructed}}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{\text{Laser}}-y_{\text{Reconstructed}}\right)^{2}} $$</equation>
	the sensor performance was evaluated. The $x_\text{Laser}$ and $y_\text{Laser}$ are the values configured in the experimental setup. The $x_\text{Reconstructed}$ and $y_\text{Reconstructed}$ are computed from the measured waveforms from each of the four channels using the machine learning algorithm&nbsp;<crossref toid="Reference: First application of machine the empirical likelihood function bla bla bla"></crossref>, which was previously trained using the <em>training scan</em>. <crossref toid="Figure: reconstruction error color map"></crossref> shows the reconstruction error fluctuations as a function of position. As can be seen in the region between the pads this is more or less uniform with an average value of about 5.5&nbsp;µm, which is remarkable for a device with a pitch of 200&nbsp;µm.</p>

<p>A number of regions were defined on the surface to focus the study. These regions are shown in <crossref toid="Figure: reconstruction error color map"></crossref>. The distribution of the reconstruction error in such regions in directions $x$ and $y$ is shown in <crossref toid="Figure: xy histograms"></crossref>, together with Gaussian fits. We start with Region&nbsp;1: The standard deviation of this region, according to the fit, is around $\sigma = 6 \text{ µm}$ for both $x$ and $y$ coordinates, as was noticed before. For Region&nbsp;2 we expect a worse behavior in $x$ direction but not a degradation in $y$, and we find looking into the fits $\sigma_x \approx 12 \text{ µm}$ and $\sigma_y \approx 5\text{ µm}$ respectively. So the spacial resolution in $x$ is about two times worse. The reason for this is that there are no pads to the left of Region&nbsp;2 so the "reconstruction power" in $x$ gets worse as we move away from the two rightmost pads. In Region&nbsp;3 and Region&nbsp;4 we can compare what happens inside a pad. Due to the fact that the opening in the pad is along the $y$ direction, and thus "breaks the symmetry in $x$ direction, the resolution for Region&nbsp;3 in $x$ direction should be ignored. If we look into the spacial resolution in $y$ we see that for Region&nbsp;3 we have $\sigma_y \approx 7.5 \text{ µm}$ and for Region&nbsp;4 we have $\sigma_y \approx 5 \text{ µm}$. The resolution is degraded, however this is probably due to the fact that in Region&nbsp;3 we are further away from the bottom left pad. A more detailed analysis can be found in&nbsp;<crossref toid="Reference: Spacial Resolution of AC-LGAD Within a Pad"></crossref>.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p>The overall resolution of a 200&nbsp;µm pitch AC-LGAD was studied using a laser. Under the best conditions, i.e. in the region between the four pads, a spacial resolution of the order of 6&nbsp;µm was achieved. </p>
